                            Our product group consists of five students, including myself. We
                            are a new group, and many of us do not know each other very well.
                            We are working together on a project to develop a job application
                            portal for a company that selects candidates using AI. 
                            We have agreed to use a Kanban board as a project
                            management tool, as it gives us a good overview of the tasks and
                            their status. In addition, the Kanban board also helps us delegate
                            tasks to the different group members.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At present, we have agreed to meet once a week to hold status
                            meetings and plan upcoming tasks. However, this will likely
                            change as we progress further into the project. We also keep in
                            touch on an ongoing basis via a group chat on Teams.

                            In addition to the group-work, I will focus on developing my
                            own skills during this project. I have enrolled in
                            Codeacademy, where I am taking a course on React followed by a course on
                            React Native in Freecodecamp. Both are important technologies for our front-end
                            development and app development. 
                            I will make use of Kolbs experiential learning cycle.
                            My concrete experience will come from completing courses on React and React Native.
                            After each learning activity, I will engage in reflective observation, considering what I found intuitive, what I struggled with, and how the content connects to the requirements of our semester project.
                            This reflection will then lead to abstract conceptualisation, where I aim to generalise key lessons, such as the benefits of component-based architecture in React.
                            Finally, I will move to active experimentation by applying these concepts directly within our project work and this portfolio-project.
